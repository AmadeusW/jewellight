# Jewel Light
A kids toy built with [Neopilxel Jewel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226), running on [Gemma M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501), loosely inspired by [Jewel Necklace](https://learn.adafruit.com/10-minute-neopixel-necklace/introduction)

It looks like flashing lights on an emergency vehicle.
